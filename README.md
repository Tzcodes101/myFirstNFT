## Description
My first NFT is the first project I completed with Solidity. The NFT features my dog, Arwin. I followed a series of tutorials to create and deploy an ERC-721 smart contract on the Ropsten test network using Metamask, Solidity, Hardhat, Pinata and Alchemy. The tutorials can be found here:

- User Story: I want to mint NFTs so that I can determine ownership of digital assets.
